Feature: Enter a search in Google

  # Simple scenario to test google search.
  Scenario: Search results should display the search term in the page title when pressing "enter"
    Given A Google search page
    When I enter the search term "Selenium"
    And I submit the search by pressing "enter"
    Then The search result page title should contain the search term
    
  # This essentially does the same thing as the above scenarios, only change is it uses data table for passing values.
  Scenario Outline: Search results should display the search term in the title regardless of submission method
    Given A Google search page
    When I enter the search term "<search_term>"
    And I submit the search by pressing "<submission_method>"
    Then The search result page title should contain the search term

  Examples: Term and submission method combinations
    | search_term | submission_method |
    | Selenium    | enter             |
